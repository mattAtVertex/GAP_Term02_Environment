# Hero Prop Texturing

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Now that you have your hero prop or group of set props modeled out, it's time to get your textures going.&nbsp; Remember that the texturing aspect is all about process.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Texturing Your Hero Prop</h2>
<p>Texturing your hero prop is the same process that we took in Term One with your capstone prop. Remember the mantra:</p>
<p><strong>Mastery is not magic. It's process.</strong></p>
<p>You'll be using the same process you've been using. Keep in mind that your hero prop will be a focal point of your scene and thus should get&nbsp;plenty of attention in this texturing phase. Other set props and background objects can get away with an assembly line approach, but your hero prop needs that extra love.</p>
<p><strong>Things to Remember for Portfolio Pieces:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Focal points need enough resolution in the texture to capture details</li>
<li>Your hero prop for your scene is the same process as The Prop in Term One</li>
<li>You should spend the extra time to get it right</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Texture Machine</h2>
<p>When we talk about The Texture Machine, it's no different from how it worked in Term One. It's all about tackling the details. The machine is a process.</p>
<p><strong>Breakdown of the Machine:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Roughness Variation</li>
<li>Color Variation</li>
<li>Value Variation</li>
<li>Gradients</li>
<li>Curvature</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Environment and History</h2>
<p>A very key aspect to a successful texture job on your Hero Prop is to take a real focus on two things:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>The environment it exists in</li>
<li>The history it has gone through</li>
</ol>
<p>The environment is an obvious part. Your scene that it currently resides in is the environment. But you need to think beyond that initial scope. Ask yourself the question: Was this prop always in this environment? Sometimes the answer is no. In those cases you need to think about where the prop has been before. This leads into the history of the prop. The history covers different environments it may have existed in before as well as how the prop has been used or what weathering effects it has gone through. The environment and history of a prop can greatly affect how it looks and have a huge impact on the texturing process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at the example image below, we have six different fire extinguishers of roughly the same brand, material makeup, and age. Their Environmental History has a huge effect on how they look now.</p>

<h2>Usage and Story</h2>
<p>Historical usage has been covered in the Environment and History section. Recent usage is another layer of detail that we add on top of that. Recent usage is that extra detail that makes the difference in the believability of your scene. Many times you can work this into your Set Props as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at the example below, we have a commercial garbage can used as a prop outside of an urban store. The version on the left has the main textures and follows all of the rules of <strong>The Texture Machine</strong>. This makes for a good start. The version on the right takes the texturing process a step further and really dives into Usage. The story being told with this garbage can is that of all the people who throw their trash into it as they walk by.&nbsp; In Substance, you can see two extra layers: One for mustard stains and one for cola stains. This tackles the story of someone walking by and throwing their half eaten lunch away.</p>
