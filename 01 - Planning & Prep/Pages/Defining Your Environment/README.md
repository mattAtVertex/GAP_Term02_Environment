# Defining Your Environment

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In this workshop&nbsp;we're going to&nbsp;prepare you for blocking out your environment.&nbsp;You'll learn tips on how to manage scope so that at the end of this term you should have a completed environment scene for your portfolio. You'll be introduced to the concepts that will help you in your journey, such as Modular Theory and Observing Reference.</p>
<h2>What We'll Cover</h2>
<ul>
<li>Choosing a Concept</li>
<li>Modular Theory</li>
<li>Setting up your Grid</li>
<li>Setting up your Unreal Project.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Choosing a Concept</h2>

<p>The first thing we need to do is pick a concept for our scene. Keep in mind that the project that you decide to do here is what you will be working on for the rest of this 12 week term.&nbsp;It's also best to&nbsp;come up with a couple of different options that you can pick from. You will also want to have some options here to make sure you follow a project that maintains a reasonable scope that you are capable of achieving by the end of the term. Get on this early, as we will be jumping into block outs immediately once decided.</p>

<p><strong>Things to consider when choosing your concept</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use a small or contained space</li>
<li>Evaluate for a reasonable scope</li>
<li>Define your focal points early on</li>
<li>Pick something that aligns with your North Star</li>

<h2>Modular Theory</h2>
<p>To develop our list of assets we need to look at it from a modular kit perspective. Thinking in a modular format, in fact, is key to working on large levels in the game development pipeline.</p>
<p>In this video, we're going to have a look at what modularity actually means and how you can begin to draft your list of assets need to create your environment.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Your Grid for a Modular Workflow</h2>
<p>&nbsp;In order to build your modular environment in the most efficient way possible, you want to be working with the appropriate scale and proportions. Setting up the grid in your modeling software from the beginning is the key to success.</p>
<p>In this video, we're going to show you the how and why behind proper grid setup. Make sure you've completed this step before the next class.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Your Unreal Project</h2>
<p>We're going to be building our environments using Unreal Engine 4. You had a taste of Unreal in Term One, now we're going to go all in with the engine and take advantage of some of the amazing features available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.vertexschool.com/products/game-artist-term-two-environment-core-lectures/categories/3309223/posts/11320151">Unreal Engine Refresher</a>&nbsp;for anything you might need a catch up on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you're setting up your project, remember to keep these key points in consideration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name your project something memorable.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Turn off auto exposure before you do anything else.</li>
<li>Define an organizational structure and stick to it</li>
</ul>
