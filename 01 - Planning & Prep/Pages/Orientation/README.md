<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Term 2 Environment Course is <strong>12 weeks</strong>. In this time, we'll be exploring some techniques for building environments, but your capstone project should be&nbsp;a major focus throughout. The goal is at the end of the 12 weeks, you will have a finished environment ready to show in your portfolio.</p>
<p>You will get the most out of this Term 2 Environment Course if you are able to contribute <strong>20 hours per week</strong> outside of class time. This gives you the opportunity to work through practice assignments to develop skillsets and then apply them to your environment.</p>

<h2>About Scope</h2>
<p>It's really easy to get inspired by grand ambitions. Try not to let yourself get caught in the trap. We want to be able to finish this and we want to be able to have something to show at the end. Try to identify early on where you can cut back on scope if you need to. This goes especially for environment artists. You can always go back and build more later, try keeping your Capstone to a smaller area and focus on that.</p>
