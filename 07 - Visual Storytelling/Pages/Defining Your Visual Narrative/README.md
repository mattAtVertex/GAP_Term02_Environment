<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>For this workshop, we have one big question to ask about our environments:</p>
<p><strong>What's the story?</strong></p>
<p>This is where visual storytelling comes in.</p>
<h2>What we'll cover</h2>
<ul>
<li>Primary Beauty Shot Composition</li>
<li>Tone and Mood</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Primary Beauty Shot</h2>
<p>Moving forward, every update should include a render of our primary beauty shot. This means it's time to really start settling down with the chosen composition for the shot.</p>
<p>Your Primary Beauty Shot is all about composition. You've likely been working with something close to your final composition since the blockout phase. Now is the time to really start dialing it in and settling on that final camera angle.</p>
<p><strong>Things to Remember</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify your primary focal point and lock onto it</li>
<li>After you set up your composition camera, it's a good idea to keep it visible in an extra viewport</li>
<li>The Rule of Thirds can be your best friend with composition</li>
<li>A secondary focal point can help balance out the image</li>
<li>It's okay to tweak composition in iterative phases</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tone and Mood</h2>
<p>We're also going to want to start dialing in our tone and mood. Tone and mood are the first things that a person will notice when&nbsp; looking at an image. There is a certain emotion that is communicated. You want to be in control of that emotion. Ask yourself this about your scene:</p>
<p><strong>What do you want your viewers to feel when they look at your primary beauty shot?</strong></p>
<p>This will help you define the message you are trying to get across and the steps you need to take in order to achieve it. The two biggest things that are going to affect this mood are <strong>lighting and atmosphere</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lighting your scene for a portfolio piece is a multi-step process. </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The first step took place back in the blockout phase. You may not have known this yet, but you were already starting to define your tone and mood back then. This is where we threw in some basic lights to get an idea of how our scene would fill out.</li>
<li>After you have much of your scene filled out and textures built, this next phase is all about cementing that mood. This is where we are now. In this phase, we really want to start defining our mood.</li>
<li>The Lighting Pass - This is where we start going through and "painting" with lights.</li>
<li>Final Lighting Pass - This comes at the end where we do our final lighting tweaks.</li>
</ol>
