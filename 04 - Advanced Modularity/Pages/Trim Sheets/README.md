<h2>What are Trim Sheets?</h2>
<p>Trim sheets are a powerful tool in the Environment artist's arsenal. They allow you to have set of thin textures all laid out into one texture sheet that you can use to construct a scene.&nbsp; In a full production environment, there is not enough memory budget to uniquely unwrap everything. Trim sheets provide the opportunity for both speed and efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
