# Hero Prop Modeling

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>When you think about environments for games, you have to remember that at their core, game environments are a collection of props. For this workshop, we're going to focus on modeling for environments. In Term One, we focused on prop modeling. Now we want to take those skills and put them to use in a full environment. There are two primary types of props we need to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hero Props</li>
<li>Set Props</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll also take some time this week to have a quick look at ZBrush for Environment Artists. This can be useful for your hero props and small props, but can also be helpful in building your trim sheets as well.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;What We'll Cover</h2>
<ul>
<li>The difference between hero props and set props</li>
<li>Defining Focal points in scenes</li>

<h1>Modeling Props for Game Environments</h1>

<p>&nbsp;The process is generally the same as what we already know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Model the High Poly</li>
<li>Model the Low Poly&nbsp;and UV</li>
<li>Bake</li>
<li>Texture</li>
</ol>
<p>The main consideration here comes down to which type of prop it is (Hero, Set, or Background) to determine how much detail you need to capture.</p>
<h2>Hero Props vs Set Props</h2>
<h3>Hero Props</h3>
<p>Hero props are important parts of the scene and are usually a focal point in the scene. These are the props you want to spend the most time and attention to. The prop you spent 2/3 of Term One on is an example of a hero prop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There can be more than one hero prop in a scene, especially if you have different camera shots.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You have to think about the focal point of your scene and make sure that you put the most love and effort into that model.</p>
<h3>Set Props</h3>
<p>Set props, or secondary props, are the props you see throughout your scene. These can be small or they can be large, but they are typically not a focal point. The bulk of the props in your scene will be set props.</p>

<p>Set props need to have quality, but you usually&nbsp;go less detailed&nbsp;on these than the hero props. Because of this, modeling them tends to go faster.</p>
<p><strong>When modeling set props for a game, there are some two questions to ask yourself:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>How close will the player get to this object?</li>
<li>How long will the typical player be looking at the object?</li>
</ol>
<p>For this course, we are<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>building portfolio pieces and not full game</strong>s, but we can tailor those questions to our purposes with a slight modification:</p>
<ol>
<li>How much screen real estate will the object take up in your scene?</li>
<li>How clearly in view will&nbsp;the object be?</li>
</ol>
<p>You want to make sure you are spending your major efforts on the the largest parts of your camera shot. Something that takes up a quarter of your scene needs to have a lot of detail. But something that only takes up a small portion of your screen real estate doesn't need as much detail.</p>
