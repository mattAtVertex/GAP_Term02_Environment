# ZBrush for Environment Artists

<p>ZBrush can be a powerful ally to the environment artist, but the way we use it can often times be quite different from the way a character artist uses it.</p>
<p>It's a powerful tool for creating organic shapes and adding damage to meshes. ZBrush can also be incredibly useful for things&nbsp;made of wood and stone.</p>
