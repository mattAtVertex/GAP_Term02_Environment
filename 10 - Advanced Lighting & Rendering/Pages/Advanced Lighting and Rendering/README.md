<h2>The Second Lighting Pass</h2>
<p>Once you have a base pass on lighting, enough to establish the mood, it's time to start refining it. While your first major lighting pass probably still has some work going into the scene (such as last minute set dressing or decal placement), the 2nd Major lighting pass is typically something that happens at the end. In a typical game studio environment with specialized jobs, the Lighting Artist comes in for the 2nd lighting pass after the level designer and environment artist are both completely finished with the environment. This is the stage where lighting as an art form gets to shine.</p>
<p>While Lighting is usually its own job in the industry, you're going to have to be your own Lighting Artist for your portfolio project here. Remember that lighting and presentation is a major key to a successful environment in your portfolio.</p>
<p>As you start tweaking your lighting, you want to remember that in most cases, less is more.</p>

<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>Atmosphere is an important part of lighting that doesn't involve just lights. Two important aspects of your scene that you build out during the lighting phase contribute to the overall mood:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Tonal Balance</strong> - This refers to the balance of color temperature in your scene</li>
<li>
<strong>Fog</strong> -&nbsp; Fog enhances both exteriors and interiors</li>
</ol>
