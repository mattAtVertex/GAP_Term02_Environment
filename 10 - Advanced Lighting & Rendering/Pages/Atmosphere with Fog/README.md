# Atmosphere with Fog

<p>Fog is an essential part to adding realistic atmosphere to your scenes and can have a strong effect on the overall mood. However, Itâ€™s really easy to overdo and easy to get lost with. Having the right amount of fog to add the right feelings to your scene can drive it to the next level. We call this adding atmosphere to the scene but it's considered a part of the lighting process, especially considering how light reacts with the fog.</p>

<h2>Fog for Exteriors</h2>

<p>The most obvious usage for fog comes with scenes that are exterior. Fog is a natural part of weather, and sometimes a byproduct of unnatural processes in the form of Smog. No matter the source, fog can give your exterior scene more depth and personality. Alternatively, it can also help obscure background elements, allowing you to get away with less detail on those elements for your portfolio scenes so you can focus more on the foreground.</p>
<p>The fog tools inside of Unreal make building fog for scenes easy. It's what they were designed for!</p>

<h2>"Fog" for Interiors</h2>

<p>A less obvious usage for fog is with interior scenes. While physically, real world fog is not something you would normally see inside, there are instances where fog-like elements do exist. A primary example would be in the dusty library above, the dust gives off a fog like look.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, you can make use of the Exponential Heightfog tool for interior only scenes, but you would want to use more subdued values to just capture a subtle hint of the fog. The heavier fog for this case would make use of fog sheets, which are transparent planes with an animated texture applied. A light smoke-like particle effect can work here as well.</p>
