# Tonal Balance

<p>Tonal Balance is all about creatively balancing the warms and cools of the scene. Often times, your scene is going to be heavy in one direction or the other. It's important to pull your scene back around to a point of balance by utilizing the complimentary.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Primarily Cool Scenes</h2>

<p>In this scene, the overall tone is cool. Blues and greens populate most of the scene. It is meant to invoke the feelings of a cold windy night with eerie undertones. To bring tonal balance to the scene, we have the brazier fires that add warm lighting to the environment. The goal in this scene is for the fires to invoke the feelings of warmth within that cold night. This balance helps the scene feel more complete.</p>

<h2>Primarily Warm Scenes</h2>

<p>In this scene, the overall scene is warm. Thematically, we're observing the environment under the heat of a strong desert sun. To balance this out, the magical elements in the scene give off cooler tones.</p>
<p>In warm scenes without magic, cooler tones may seem like they are harder to achieve. This is why in warm scenes it's important to take advantage of your shadowy areas. You want to have soft cool shadows to help bring balance. From a technical standpoint in Unreal Engine, this is where your Skylight is going to give you a lot of power.</p>

<h2>Middle Balanced Scenes</h2>

<p>It's not often that you have a scene that is a balanced struggle of warms and cools, but depending on your scene, this could make sense. The secret to getting that good balance in this case is the blend. Notice how in the image, the left side is strong cool lighting with soft cool shadows while the right side is strong warm lighting with soft warm shadows. In the middle, we let these color temperatures blend like a gradient.</p>
