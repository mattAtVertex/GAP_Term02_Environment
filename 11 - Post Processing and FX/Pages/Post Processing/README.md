# Post Processing

<h2>The Post Processing Pass</h2>
<p>Once you have all of your lights in the scene set up and tweaked to get the best results you can, the next step is the post processing pass. This is where you take advantage of the effects you can achieve with a Post Process Volume in your scene. Color Grading is the main effect that you will be using to polish off the final lighting. This is where you will control things like White Balance, Saturation, and even modify the overall look with Color Lookup Tables (LUTs).</p>
